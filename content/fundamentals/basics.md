This page is gonna have a lot of information on it and to be honest, it'll be a bit of a slog to read through it all the way. In general, this page has a list of all the status effects possible, stats, and an overview of damage and armor (damage reduction), and most things related to character control like how abilities work and the health bar and all that jazz.



## CC and Status Effects

One of the biggest parts of Heroes and all battle arena games is the use of crowd control abilities to remove or interfere with a players control of their character. This can come in a wide variety of status effects.

### Buffs

These are all the various buffs you can gain or be given. There are a few I left off to cover in a different bit of this page. If you need a refresher on what a hero can do or who can get one of these buffs in particular, visit that heroes index page.

| Buffs        | Description                                                  | Examples              |
| :----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Stasis       | Stasis removes a hero from the fight for a while by making them untargetable and immune to damage, while also removing debuffs. | H                     |
| Invulnerable | Invulnerable makes your hero untargetable by the enemy team only and removes all debuffs from the affected hero. **Invulnerable heroes are immune to CC.** | Uther: Divine Shield  |
| Protected    | Protected prevents heroes from taking both spell and auto attack damage while still rewarding the enemy team for any quest progress. **Protected heroes are still vulnerable to CC.** | Medivh: Force of Will |
| Invisible    | Some heroes when stealthed can remain stationary for a set duration to go completely invisible while remaining stationary. | Nova: Trait           |
| Stealth      | Stealth is a visual buff that makes it harder for the enemy team to see the player. Some heroes rely on stealth as a core mechanic. If you remain stationary for a set duration, you may go invisible. | Nova: Trait           |
| Unkillable   | As of patch 2.50, unkillable is only given by Zul'Jin's heroic **Taz'Dingo.** |                       |
| Unstoppable  | Unstoppable is a buff that can be self cast or given to another hero that removes current CC effects and prevents further applications for a set duration. | S                     |
| Absorb       | As of patch 2.50, absorb is only given by Yrel's heroic ***Ardent Defender.*** |                       |
| Evasion      | Evasion causes auto attacks to miss the affected hero for the duration of the buff and does not allow stacks/quest progress to occur. | Illidan: Evasion      |

### Debuffs

This is a list of all the different forms of debuffs that can be placed on you with some special exceptions that I will talk about in other parts of the index. There isn't really much else to say about this. As you play the game you will learn what heroes has access to all these different types of CC and if you don't remember, I have lists of all CC a hero has access to on their index page.

| Debuff       | Can move freely | Can auto | Can Cast | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | --------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Time Stop    | No              | No       | No       | Completely removes a character from the fight by freezing them in place. |
| Taunt        | No              | Yes      | No       | Forces the hero to move into auto attack range and attack the source. |
| Stunned      | No              | No       | No       | Causes the hero to lose all control over the hero for a set duration while allowing allies and enemies to target them. |
| Sleep        | No              | No       | No       | Similar to Stunned however a hero who is asleep will be woken up by the first source of damage they take. |
| Root         | No              | Yes      | Yes      | Roots will hold heroes in place for the duration of the root. |
| Silence      | Yes             | Yes      | No       | The silenced player can still move freely and auto attack but cannot use any abilities. |
| Blinded      | Yes             | No       | Yes      | Blinded heroes will cause their auto attacks to miss the target, not incurring any quest progress/stacks. |
| Polymorph    | Yes             | No       | No       | Polymorph is a special type of silence that also removes your ability to auto attack. |
| Feared       | No              | No       | No       | W                                                            |
| Mind Control | No              | No       | No       | A mind controlled hero will move towards the caster in a straight line until the duration is over or they reach the caster. |

## Damage and Health

We all know how damage and health works because most of us have played video games before so I'll skip to the stuff that you actually need to know about damage and health.

### Damage

The most important thing you need to understand about dealing damage in Heroes is that it can come in two forms; auto attack damage and spell damage. 

#### Auto Attacks

Auto attack is based on two factors in Heroes of the Storm; **attack range** and **attack speed**. If you've played other games you can guess what these two stats are but in Heroes of the Storm, abilities and movement are measured with one standard unit I call a **Range (r)**. One Range is the smallest unit of size in Heroes and is equal to the hitbox of Erik, one of the Lost Vikings.

When auto attacking in Heroes, it's important to **shutter step** as you move across the battlefield. Similar to the way a shutter works on a camera, you need to move a little, stop and attack, then move a little more, then stop and attack. This allows you to move while still doing damage and most of the time can allow you to re-position without losing any pressure on the enemy team.

#### Spell Damage

Spell damage, or sometimes reffered to as ability damage, is any and all damage dealth by a player that is not auto attack damage. Like I said above, there are only two kinds of damage so it's got to fit into either one and most damage lands in the spell category.

Spell damage is modified in two simple ways; you can reduce the **Cooldown** of spells and abilities through Talents.

### Health

#### Healing

#### Shields
